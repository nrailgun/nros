NROS
====
NROS is a operating system prototype on x86. NROS is still under construct. The
reasons I implement this tiny toy OS are fun, and hoping it help me understand
operating system better.

# Acknowledgements
NROS's inspired by Xv6, and Linux 0. Check [this link](
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html) for more information about Xv6.

NROS borrows code from the following sources:
* Xv6
* Linux 0.01

# Error reports
If any one interests in my project and spot errors, or have suggestions for
improvement, please send me a email (shibuyanorailgun@foxmail.com).

# Building and Running
I'm sorry, but until now, NROS's tested only on x86 Ubuntu 14.04, with GCC-4.8,
GNU-binutils-4.6.

On an x86 ELF machine (Linux or something), just type:
```bash
make
```

By the way, you may need:
* GCC-4.8
* GNU-binutils-4.6
